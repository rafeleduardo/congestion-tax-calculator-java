# Questions

## Handling Edge Cases

1. How should the system handle invalid date formats or missing dates?
2. What should be the behavior if a date falls exactly on the boundary of two different tax rates?

## Technical Implementation

3. Is the structure of the request payload correct? Do we need any additional fields or validation?

## Error Handling

4. What kind of error responses should be returned for different types of errors (e.g., invalid input, processing errors)?
5. How should exceptions be logged or reported in the system?

## Performance Testing
6. Are there any performance requirements for the tax calculation (e.g., maximum processing time)?
7. How should the system handle large volumes of date inputs in a single request?

## Documentation
8. What level of documentation is expected for the API and the underlying logic?
9. Are there any specific documentation standards or templates that should be followed?
